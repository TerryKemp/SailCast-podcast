How the app works
The home screen displays a list of currently trending Outdoor lifestyle podcasts using the iTunes API. The user must register or login to create a playlist. Once logged in, the user can search the iTunes database with the results displayed in a carousel by slick.

Wireframing with Balsamiq
 Balsamiq was used to create the wire frames. to plan the app. This assisted with the fast and easy planning of SailCast.

Comment section to allow users to write comments.
Like button that will allow users to like a podcast and share it to their social network.
