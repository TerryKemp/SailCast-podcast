# SailCast-podcast

Introduction
SailCast is a simple full stack app where you can create a playlist of your favourite podcasts. With Sailcast you can search, listen, and share your favorite with your friends.  The technology used is node.js & express.


How the app works
The home screen displays a list of currently trending Outdoor lifestyle podcasts using the iTunes API. The user must register or login to create a playlist. Once logged in, the user can search the iTunes database with the results displayed in a carousel by slick.

Wireframing with Balsamiq
 Balsamiq was used to create the wire frames. to plan the app. This assisted with the fast and easy planning of SailCast.
